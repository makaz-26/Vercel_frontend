        Mining USDT (Tether) is a common misconception,
        as USDT is not a mineable cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
        Instead, USDT is a stablecoin issued by Tether Ltd and backed by reserves,
        maintaining a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. It is created through a centralized process,
        not decentralized mining. However, some platforms misleadingly advertise "USDT mining,"
        which usually refers to investment schemes, liquidity mining, or staking services that offer USDT rewards.
        Users should exercise caution and ensure platforms are legitimate to avoid scams.
        Always research thoroughly before engaging in any activity claiming to offer USDT through "mining."
